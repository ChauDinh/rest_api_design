# REST API Design in Node.JS

## What we will cover?

* What is REST?
* How to make a REST API?

## Notes:

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a porpular architecture style for web API design.

The base idea is to put a thin layer of logic on the top of database where through the webserver, the client can perform controlled updates to the database.

Things are rarely this simple and most professional grade servers break the REST practices in favour of more pragmatic approaches but even so the base design is very dependable.
